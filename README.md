## Tips/Run

* Run "dotnet run" to run the API for practical use for production or for testing within Postman;
* When creating a new SQL user, be sure to set the SQL Server properties to "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode" (under the Security tab), and reset the "sqlservr.exe" (SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)) service;

## Errors Experienced

* Abc;

## Notes:

* Run "ctor" in a class and hit tab twice to build a constructor within a class;
* Run "prop" in a class and hit tab twice to build a property within a class;
* Run "dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration" to add a migration;
* Run "dotnet ef migrations remove" to remove a migration;
* Run "dotnet ef database update" to create the database based on the migration;
* User secrets have not been added so connection is in plain sight, credentials are mock and are not used anywhere on the internet; this is for tutorial purposes only;

## What's it all about?

* In this full course, we show you how to build a full REST API using .NET Core 3.1. Weâ€™ll employ MVC, REST, the Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, Entity Framework, Data Transfer Objects, (DTOs), AutoMapper to provide 6 API endpoints that will allow you to Create, Read Update and Delete resources;
